Question 5:
# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City?

## First we subset the motor vehicles, which we assume is anything like Vehicle in EISector column
SCCvehicle<-grepl(pattern = "vehicle", SCC$EISector, ignore.case = TRUE)
SCCvehicleSCC <- SCC[SCCvehicle,]$SCC

## using this boolean vector get the interested rows from the baltimore data
NEIvehicleSSC <- NEIdata[NEIdata$SCC %in% SCCvehicleSCC, ]
NEIvehicleBaltimore <- subset(NEIvehicleSSC, fips == "24510")
NIEvehicleBaltimoreTotEm<-aggregate(Emissions~year, NEIvehicleBaltimore, su

## Plotting the year-Emissions  
g<-ggplot(aes(year, Emissions/10^5), data=NIEvehicleBaltimoreTotEm)
g+geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + 
  labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore from 1999-2008"))
