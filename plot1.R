Question 1
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
# Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources 
# for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

## Firstly, aggregate the data in
totalEmission <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, NEIdata, sum)
totalEmission

## Plotting the total Emissions over time using a base plotting in
barplot(
  (totalEmission$Emissions)/10^6,
  names.arg=totalEmission$year,
  xlab="Year",
  ylab="PM2.5 Emissions (10^6 Tons)",
  main="Total PM2.5 Emissions From All US Sources"
)
